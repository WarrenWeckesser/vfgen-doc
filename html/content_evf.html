<h2>EVF</h2>
<p>
The EVF command creates a new vector field in which an existing vector field
is extended with its variational equations.
</p>
<p>
Often it is useful to solve the <i>variational equations</i> of a vector field.
One simple way to do this is to create a system consisting of the original vector
field <b>x</b>'=<b>F</b>(<b>x</b>)
and the variational equation d<b>x</b>' = D<b>F</b>(<b>x</b>)d<b>x</b>, where
D<b>F</b>(<b>x</b>) is the Jacobian at <b>x</b>.
(For example, this is the system created in the file with the suffix "_evf.m"
in VFGEN's MATLAB command.)  However, you will not have an explicit Jacobian
of the <i>extended</i> system, unless you write the function
yourself. 
</p>
<p>
An alternative is to use the EVF command of VFGEN.  The output of this
command is a new vector field specification 
in which the original vector field has been extended with
the variational equations.
The new vector field is a 2N dimensional
system that consists of the original vector field plus its variational
equation.  The symbols used for the extended variables are the same as
the original variables with the letter "d" prepended to them. For example,
if the original system uses the variables x and y, the new system
will use x, y, dx, and dy.  After running your vector field file through
VFGEN to create the extended vector field, you can use VFGEN to output the
extended system in the format of your choice, and you will automatically
have the Jacobian(s) of the extended system.

<h4>Options</h4>
<table class="options">
<tr>
<td>
<b>par</b> &nbsp;
</td>
<td>
If the option <b>par=</b><i>p</i> is given, where <i>p</i> is a <b>Parameter</b>,
the vector field is extended with the equations
<br>
<center>
   d<b>x</b>' = D<b>F</b>(<b>x</b>) d<b>x</b> + D<sub>p</sub><b>F</b>(<b>x</b>)
</center>
<br>
<i>Default</i>: If the <b>par</b> option is not specified, the Jacobian with
respect to a parameter is not added to D<b>F</b>(<b>x</b>)d<b>x</b>
in the extended vector field.

<h4>Example</h4>
<p>
Here is an example of using the EVF command with
the input vector field file
<a href="example_vf/pendulum.vf">pendulum.vf</a>.
<div class="mypre">$ vfgen evf:par=b pendulum.vf > pendulum_evf.vf</div>
</p>
<p>
Note that, unlike most VFGEN commands, the ouput is sent to the console
rather than a file.
In this example, we have redirected the output to the file
<a href="example_evf/pendulum_evf.vf">pendulum_evf.vf</a>.
