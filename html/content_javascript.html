<h2>Javascript</h2>
<p>
Javascript is a programming language that is understood by many web browsers.
</p>
<h3>The VFGEN Javascript Command</h3>
<p>
The <b>javascript</b> command generates Javascript code that can be used to
implement a Taylor method solver for the vector field.
</p>
<p>
A javascript file called <b>[name].js</b> is created by the command
<div class="mypre">$ vfgen javascript vector_field_file.vf</div>
where [name] is the name of the vector field given in the vector field file.
The javascript file contains functions that compute the vector field, and
higher order derivatives of the vector field, and a function that evaluates
an approximate solution based on the Taylor expansion.  See the
<a href="menu_taylor.html">taylor command</a> for more background; the javascript
command is basically the same, but it generates javascript code instead of C
code.
</p>
<p>
The <b>javascript</b> command does not handle delay equations.

<h4>Options</h4>
<table class="options">
<tr>
<td>
<b>demo</b>
</td>
<td>
If the option <b>demo=yes</b> is given, two additional files are created:
<ul>
    <li><b>[name].html</b> is an HTML file that creates a user interface for the
        Taylor method solver.  It includes a graphical display of the solution, and
        several controls and input fields for controlling the solver.
        The HTML file must be viewed with a browser that supports the
        <b>canvas</b> object.
    </li>
    <li><b>[name]_solverdemo.js</b> contains javascript functions used in the
        HTML file.  Included in this file is a Taylor method solver for the vector
        field.
    </li>
</ul>
<i>Default</i>: <b>demo=no</b>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<b>order</b>
</td>
<td>
This option specifies the highest order
retained in the Taylor series.
The order must be a positive integer.
<br />
<i>Default</i>: <b>order=5</b>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h4>Example</h4>
<p>
A vector field file for the Lorenz equations is <a href="example_vf/lorenz.vf">lorenz.vf</a>.
<br />
The files created by
<div class="mypre">$ vfgen javascript:order=7,demo=yes lorenz.vf</div>
<br />
are
<ul>
  <li><a href="example_javascript/lorenz.js">lorenz.js</a></li>
  <li><a href="example_javascript/lorenz_solverdemo.js">lorenz_solverdemo.js</a></li>
  <li><a href="example_javascript/lorenz.html">lorenz.html</a></li>

  </li>
</ul>
Clicking on <a href="example_javascript/lorenz.html">lorenz.html</a> will bring
you to the HTML/Javascript solver that was generated by VFGEN.
Right-click on the link to download the HTML file, or following the link and use the
<b>View Source</b> command in your browser (for example, <b>View</b>&rarr;<b>Page Source</b> in
Firefox or <b>View</b>&rarr;<b>View Source</b> in Safari).
