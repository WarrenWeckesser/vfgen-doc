<h2>MATCONT</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/matcont/">MATCONT and CL_MATCONT</a>
are MATLAB programs for doing numerical continuation.
From the MATCONT web page: "The aim of <b>MATCONT</b>
and <b>CL_MATCONT</b> is to provide a continuation toolbox which is compatible
with the standard MATLAB ODE representation of differential equations."
</p>
<h3>The VFGEN MATCONT Command</h3>
<p>
A MATCONT file is created by the command
<div class="mypre">$ vfgen matcont vector_field_file.vf</div>
<p>
One file is created, called <b>[name].m</b>, where [name] is the name
given in the vector field file.
The first function in the this file
has the same name as the vector field.  The return value of this function, out,
will be:
<p>
<table class="options">
<tr>
<td width="30%"><i>Return Value</i></td>
<td><i>MATCONT Meaning</i></td>

<tr>
<td>out{1} = @[name]_init;</td>

<tr>
<td>out{2} = @[name]_vf;</td>
<td>Vector field function</td>

<tr>
<td>out{3} = @[name]_jac;</td>

<tr>
<td>out{10} = @[name]_[user1]; <br />
out{11} = @[name]_[user2]; <br />
<i>etc.</i>
</td>
<td>If any user functions are defined, they will also be implemented in
the output file, and references to the function will be stored in 
out{10}, out{11}, etc.

<b><i>Note</i></b>
<p>
I have only tested the files create by VFGEN with <b>CL_MATCONT</b>.
The demonstration scripts below are to be used with <b>CL_MATCONT</b>.
<h4>Example 1</h4>
<p>
Section 7.4 of the MATCONT manual 
"<i>MATCONT and CL MATCONT:
Continuation Toolboxes in Matlab</i>"
(A. Dhooge, <i>et al</i>, December 2006)
discusses the <i>Bratu example</i>.
A vector field file that defines the differential equations for this
example is <a href="example_vf/bratu.vf">bratu.vf</a>.
A MATLAB definition file for MATCONT is created with the command
<div class="mypre">$ vfgen matcont bratu.vf</div>
This creates the file <a href="example_matcont/bratu.m">bratu.m</a>.
</p>
<p>
The MATLAB script <a href="example_matcont/bratu_script.m">bratu_script.m</a>
contains the commands given in Section 7.4 of the manual.  Here is the plot
generated by this script:

<img class="exampleplot" src="example_matcont/bratu_plot.png" />
</center>
</p>
<h4>Example 2</h4>
<p>
We will use MATCONT to do two parameter continuation of limit points and Hopf points
in the <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Morris-Lecar_model">Morris-Lecar equations</a>.
A vector field file for these equations is
<a href="example_vf/MorrisLecar.vf">MorrisLecar.vf</a>.
<br>
The file created by
<div class="mypre">$ vfgen matcont MorrisLecar.vf</div>
<br>
is <a href="example_matcont/MorrisLecar.m">MorrisLecar.m</a>.
</p>
<p>
The MATLAB script <a href="example_matcont/MorrisLecar_script.m">MorrisLecar_script.m</a>
first computes a curve of equilibrium by varying the parameter <b>ic</b>.
Two limit points and a Hopf point are found on this curve.
The script then does two parameter continuation (using <b>ic</b> and <b>gca</b>)
of a limit point and of the Hopf point.
Here is the plot generated by the script:
<center>
<img class="exampleplot" src="example_matcont/MorrisLecar_plot.png" />
</center>
(The extraneous red dots are the starting points of the curves; each was computed in
stages, forward and backward.  The BT point is labeled twice because it was detected
on both the Hopf curve and the limit point curve.)
