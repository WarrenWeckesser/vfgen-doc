<p>
VFGEN is a command-line program. The first argument to the command determines
the format of the output that is generated.
A typical invocation of VFGEN looks like
<div class="mypre">$ vfgen <i>command</i> <i>vector-field-file</i></div>
Some commands take options; these are specified by
putting a colon after the command, and then giving a
list of <i>option=value</i> pairs, separated by commas:
<div class="mypre">$ vfgen <i>command</i>:<i>option=value,option=value,...</i> <i>vector-field-file</i></div>
</p>
<p>
The menu on the left provides links to the various section of the User's Guide.
The menu entry labeled "Vector Field File" links to the description of the
vector field file used by VFGEN to define a vector field.
The remaining menu entries below "User's Guide" are all the VFGEN commands.
The documentation for each command includes examples of its use.
