<h2>DSTool</h2>
<p>
From the <a href="http://www.dynamicalsystems.org/sw/sw/detail?item=11">DSWeb description of DSTool</a>:
"DsTool is a toolkit for exploring dynamical systems. It is an efficient research tool that integrates a friendly graphical user interface, data management capabilities, a rich set of numerical algorithms together with the flexibility to add more algorithms and communicate data with other programs."

<h3 class="title">The VFGEN DSTool Command</h3>
<p>
A C file that can be used to define a vector field for DSTool
is created by the command
<div class="mypre"> $ vfgen dstool vector_field_file.vf</div>
<p>
The name of the C file will be <b>[name]_def.c</b>, where
<b>[name]</b> is the name of the vector field given in the vector field file. 
The C file will define the functions <b>[name]</b>, <b>[name]_jac</b>,
<b>[name]_dfdt</b>, <b>[name]_dfdp</b>,
<b>[name]_aux</b>, and <b>[name]_init</b>.
<p>
Note: The current vector field format does not contain as much information
as can be used by DSTool.  For example, it is not possible to specify
ranges of the variables, parameters or functions (to be used, for example,
as the limits of plots).
To use these features of DSTool, you will have to edit the file created
by VFGEN.
<p>
VFGEN only creates the "_def.c" file.  You will still have to 
configure DSTool to install your vector field.
Consult the DSTool User Manual for instructions.

<h4>Example</h4>
<p>
Here is a sample vector field file: <a href="example_vf/pendulum.vf">pendulum.vf</a>.
<br>
The file created by
<div class="mypre">$ vfgen dstool pendulum.vf</div>
<br>
is <a href="example_dstool/pendulum_def.c">pendulum_def.c</a>.
